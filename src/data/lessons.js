            "Star Ocean, released July 19, 1996, was a true demonstration of what the Super Famicom was truly capable of. While it weighed in at a massive 6 megabytes, the game was actually much larger, and only fit on a cartridge double the size of Final Fantasy 6's due to graphics compression allowed by the S-DD1 chip. The chip was only ever used in two Super Famicom games (The other being Street Fighter Alpha 2,) thanks to the fact that the 32 bit era was rapidly picking up steam in 1996.",
            "The story, heavly influenced by Star Trek, involves the crew of the 'federation' starship Calnus investgating a virus on Planet Roak. The Calnus crew is seen beaming down by natives of the less technologiclally advanced planet, running  afoul of the 'Underdeveloped Planet Preservation Pact.' The Roak natives initially think the Calnus crew are gods, but the Calnus crew explain otherwise. Eventually, both space travelers and Roakians alike go 300 years in the past, to a time where they're able to save the planet, eventually going back to the present and stopping 'Jie Revorse' and his genetically enhanced supermen from taking over the universe.",
            "I joke, of course, but the game is incredible. It features a very cinimatic, fully (English) voiced intro cutscene featuring Robert Belgrade, who would go on to voice Alucard in the English version of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. The game also boasts an amazing soundtrack by Motoi Sakuraba which sounds higher quality than almost anything else on the system, a really fun action battle system, and gameplay systems that wouldn't become common until well into the Playstation's life (you like item creation systems? Thank Star Ocean.)"

            "Tales of Destiny is the second title in the Tales series. Coming two years after the first one, and possibly being moved from Nintendo 64 (there were rumors of ‘Tales of Phantasia 2’ for N64 at one point, but it never materialized, and there doesn't seem to be any concrete information about this. The game has some high points, and some really low points.",
            "The highest point is that it has one of the greatest game soundtracks ever made. Almost every song is worth listening to, which is a major feat as for as video game soundtracks go, especially among the Tales series, where soundtracks consist about 20% good songs and 80% filler.",
            "Some of the low points are the battle system, which is pretty much just lifted straight out of Tales of Phantasia and has not aged well to the point where if you play the original Tales of Destiny (we'll get to the remake in a bit) after playing most Tales games that came after it, the game is pretty much unplayable. Couple that with an absolutely insane random encounter rate, and you have a game that's a flat out chore to play.",
            "Even with this mixed bag of elements throughout, the game also varies in quality depending on how far into it you get.",
            "The first half of the game is incredible, giving you one of the Tales series's best casts on an adventure to recover a powerful artifact known as the Eye of God (or Atamoni depending on which version of the game you're playing) before it can be used to take over the world.",
            "The pacing takes a major hit in the second half. While the story itself remains good, bringing the villains into focus and giving them good motivations, the game becomes a major chore to play. After a certain emotional scene about halfway through, you go to a second world map and the game becomes more of a dungeon crawler where the dungeons aren't very fun to play.",
            "Most of them take the form of transporter mazes where you have to go up and down just to find the way to the end, occasionally broken up by puzzles, and there are far too many dungeons, the sheer number of which makes the plot feel like it stops short. For example, let's look at the first mission in this area, go to a dungeon and do a thing (no spoilers.) Instead of going onto a world map, into the dungeon, finishing it and going back to where you started, you have to:",
            "1. Go through a section of a world map, which is so much of a maze, it may as well be a mini dungeon in itself.",
            "2. Go through one dungeon to teleport to another",
            "3. Go through that dungeon to get back to the world map",
            "4. Go through another mini dungeon on the world map",
            "5. Finally get to the dungeon you were aiming for.",
            "That's essentially five dungeons where one would've done the trick nicely, and the game continues like this for at least a quarter of its total time!",
            "The remake, which came out as the last Tales game on the PlayStation 2, released right in the middle of the series’ golden age, gives us some new plot elements, as well as skits and a totally new battle system. The battle system completely does away with TP, rather focusing on what you can do in individual combos by having moves use CC, a new type of TP which recovers after each combo. The battle system is really fun, so that fixes that problem from the original. If only the rest of the original's problems were fixed as well.",
            "The pacing issues? Still there in their entirety. The new battle system makes the second half less of a slog, but it's still a slog due to the fact that the dungeons are still the same mazes of transporters. There are new puzzles here and there, but the dungeons really haven't changed much, which is a huge negative in this game.",
            "There is a Director's Cut of the remake, which adds ‘Leon Side,’ a mode where you play the first half of the story with Leon as the main character, and stops right before the second half of the game starts. It won't give you the full story of the game, but it will give you a full story with a beginning, middle, and end which stops before the game gets annoying, and is therefore probably the best way to play the game.",
            "Tales of Destiny can be a joy to play, but at times is also a massive pain. If the story grabs you enough, it can be worth forcing yourself through the second half of the game to see how things turn out, but otherwise the second half is just gonna sap your patience.",
            "Fun Fact: Hikaru Midorikawa, the voice actor for the anti-social Leon also did the voice of Hiro in the 32-bit remake of Lunar 2. Guy's got range."
